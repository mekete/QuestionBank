Choose the best alternative and blacken the letter of your choice on the separate answer sheet provided.<br/><br/>1 When I was in junior high school, my parents gave me a typewriter. My friends Amy Neff and Carol Stein often walked with me to my after school. We closed my bedroom and spent the afternoon giggling - or rolling on the carpet, howling with lunatic laughter - as we tapped out silly limericks and satirical stories on my typewriter.Once we even wrote a play.<br/><br/>2 Our after-school typing was not homework. We rambled wherever our teenage imaginations took us; we explored words wildly for the pure fun of it, with no exams or report cards in mind. We practiced literacy risk-takings and problem solving, honed our language skills and learning perseverance, all with no fear of failure - because we were playing. Few children today have time for this kind of after-school play. There is too much homework. Parents concerns about overload have become a familiar story as schools all over the country pile on homework in a mis-aimed response to criticism that they were teaching too little. Some elementary teachers routinely assign time-consuming work in each of three or four academic subjects every night.<br/><br/>3 Amy Neff, one of the friends who helped me enjoy my typewriter in junior high, learned at a school meeting in May that in fifth grade her 10-year-old daughter would have an hour and a half to two hours of homework seven days a week, plus special projects. \"The idea is that, under avalanche of work, children should learn to organize their time efficiently,\" she wrote me in an e-mail message. \"Nobody has mentioned creativity: ideas and content of what is learned. Just doing LOTS, FAST!\"<br/><br/>4 The parents and grandparents of todays children had time \"playing  around\" with stamp collections or model airplanes, writing a fairy-What many people do not realize is that these kinds of interests and<br/><br/>5 Many successful adults have a childhood history of free wheel play.Louis Ignarro, a Nobel Prize winning Pharmacologist, had six successively complex chemistry sets and played with model rockets. When Letty Cottin Pogerbin, President of the Authors. Guild, an association of published writers, was 9, she spent afternoons writing and drawing for a monthly magazine she printed on a primitive press called hectograph, She charged friends and family 3 cents a copy and then mailed each copy with a 3-cent stamp. She recalls now, 'I never understood why the magazine did not make a profit.\" But that is just the point: when kids play, they are free to experiment and learn from experiences, without worrying about how well they are performing.<br/><br/>6 Though homework has a clear benefit in high school, there is no research showing that any amount of it advances the education of elementary school kids. They may be stuffing a great deal of information into their heads, but after an hour or two, children lose any eagerness or joy they have in learning. That is important because research has shown that when children enjoy it, their learning is deeper, richer, and longer-lasting.<br/><br/>7. Parents do have some recourse. They can meet with principals and teachers, organize other parents, and protest. Parents in several communities have prevailed upon school districts to enact homework ' limits. For their children, at least, there may still be time to indulge in the ancient and powerful medium for learning known as play.<br/><br/><b>Source: <i>Destinations: An Integrated Approach to Writing</i></b>"
